# Overview

This project is an idea from my wife and this was my first project in C++, I really have liked OOP languages and wanted to see how C++ works and get a feel for the syntax.

This project uses a lot of conditions in it and it is designed to give advice to husbands who may have annoyed their spouse.

I wrote this project so I could better understand C++ and get better at OOP in general.

# Development Environment

I used the Visual Studio Community 2022 Editor to create this app.

I used C++ and the standard libraries for this program.

# Future Work

* In the future I would love to expand this and offer more advice.
* I think addding a GUI would be fun and challenging.
* It would be nice to have a more advanced or true RND (Random Number Generator).
